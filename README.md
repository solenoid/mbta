# Balance Rocks

Experiment with the MBTA API a bit.

## Getting Started

You'll need to get dependencies and use pika to make them available as web modules.

```
npm install && npm run prepare
```

To run things locally start up local server.

```
npm start
```

After that's running visit the site:

<http://localhost:5000/>
