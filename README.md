# Balance Rocks

Experiment with the MBTA API a bit.

## Getting Started

You'll need to get dependencies and prepare them as `web_modules` with [pika](https://www.pikapkg.com/).

```
npm install
```

To run things locally start up local server.

```
npm start
```

After that's running visit the site:

<http://localhost:5000/>

## Experiments

I'm trying out both pika and preact to see what a more minimal web setup of the future is kinda like today.

Some good reading on some of the more novel parts over a classic piece of CRApp are from these resources.
